# Work in Progress MicroGO

In MicroGO, I take some of the most valuable features in Laravel and implement similar functionality in Go.

Since Go is compiled and type-safe, web applications written in this language are typically much faster and far 
less error-prone than an equivalent application, Laravel, written in PHP.
